## üíÄ And what about the Mob Heads?

Mob Heads are dropped by their specific mobs. 
The drop rate is unchanged from other mobs dropping their Head or Skull.
Meaning a Battleaxe or Chopping Blocks increase the drop rate.
- Entities with different states drop corresponding Mob Head variants - e.g. Hunger Level.
- Animals that can wear Breeding Harness have a related Mob Head.
- Sheep drop a Mob Head in the color of their fleece, but the head drop is only guaranteed when grown up from a baby sheep.
